# HowToFindAreaCirclesAndSpheres
The objective of this project is to write a program using a vvariable and mathematical operations. 
Given the radius of a circle, and the value of π (3.14159) the diameter, circumference, and
area of a circle can be calculated as well as the surface area and volume of a sphere. Your
program should choose a floating-point number to use for the radius, and then calculate and
output the following values using that radius:

• diameter: the diameter is twice the radius
• circumference: the circumference is 2πr
• area: the area is πr2
• surface area: the surface area is 4πr2
• volume: the volume of a sphere with that radius is 4/3πr3
